- Media queries used to make responsive webpage

### What I learned

This challenge provided me opportunities to learn many new things. The most amazing thing I learned in this challenge is to use the vectors icons and social logos taken from site [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  The `iframe` HTML element is great way to embed other pages into your website. I used this tag to embed a Youtube video, also you can embed google maps and other websites into your webpage. The desing is taken from the original Apple Airpods webpage.
